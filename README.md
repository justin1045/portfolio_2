## âœ¨ How It Works

### ðŸ”„ Scroll-Based Reveal Animation

- `ReviewOnScroll` uses `IntersectionObserver` to detect when a section enters the viewport.
- When the component is at least 20% visible, it adds the `visible` class to trigger a CSS animation.

**CSS in `index.css`:**

```css
.reveal {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
  transition: opacity 0.7s ease, transform 0.7s ease;
}

.reveal.visible {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
